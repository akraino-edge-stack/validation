      "message": "Your approach is better. However, it does not provide to the developer the ability to build the UI image using a modified UI source code, as it always downloads the UI from the repo.\n\nI suggest the followings:\n-Leave the code here as is in your patch, as I believe the docker directory aims to build images for the production environment. \n- Modify the pom.xml file of the UI source code to support the build of an appropriate image containing the modified code. This will concern only the development environment.\n- Move the deploy.sh to the UI source code directory, as it does not longer belong here.\n\nI you agree, I can update the patch.",
