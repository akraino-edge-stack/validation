Akraino Blueprint Validation UI
========

Introduction
------------

This project contains the source code of the Akraino Blueprint Validation UI. It is based on the ONAP portal SDK, version 2.4.0. It should be noted that the copyright of all the files of the aforementioned project that were left intact, has not been changed.

This UI consists of the front-end and back-end parts.

The front-end part is based on HTML, CSS, and AngularJS technologies. The back-end part is based on Spring MVC and Apache Tomcat technologies.

Based on these instructions, a user can provide the prerequisites, compile the source code and deploy the UI.

Scope
-----

The blueprint validation UI aims to be hosted by LF servers and will be exposed using public IP and domain names.

It provides a user-friendly way for displaying blueprints validation test results. Based on these results, the status of a blueprint can be determined (mature, incubation state, etc.).

In specific, the purpose of the UI is twofold:

1) Support full control loop of producing results. In this mode, the UI must be connected with a Jenkins instance capable of running blueprint validation tests.
   It will enable the user to define a blueprint for validation using its name, version, layer, desired lab and desired timeslot. This data constitutes a submission. It should be noted that the blueprint family is derived from the blueprint name.
   Also, the UI will have the ability to track the lifecycle of a submission. A submission state can be one of the following: submitted, waiting, running and completed. The implementation vehicle for this action is the REST API of Jenkins.
   Moreover, the UI must be connected with a mariadb instance and the Nexus server where the results are stored.
   Then, it will be able to trigger the appropriate job in Jenkins and receive the corresponding results from Nexus.
   Note that it makes no difference whether the Jenkins instance is the community one or a private one.
2) Partial control of producing results. In this mode, the UI must be connected with a mariadb instance and the Nexus server where the results are stored.
   Every blueprint owner is responsible of executing tests and storing results in Nexus using his/her own Jenkins instance. The UI only retrieves results from Nexus and displays them.

Currently, the partial control loop is not supported.

In both modes, user authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) will be supported in order to control access to resources, enforce policies on these resources and audit their usage.

Prerequisites:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for the blueprint validation UI to be functional, the following items are taken for granted:

- An appropriate mariadb instance is up and running (look at the Database subsection).
  This prerequisite concerns both of the UI modes.

- The available labs for blueprint validation execution are defined by the corresponding lab owners (look at the Database subsection). It is their responsibility to publish them. Currently, this data is statically stored in the blueprint validation UI mariadb database. In order for a lab owner to update them, he/her must update the corresponding table entries. This inconvenience will be handled in the future.
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- The available timeslots for blueprint validation execution of every lab are defined by the corresponding lab owners (look at the Database subsection). It is their responsibility to publish them. Currently, this data is statically stored in the blueprint validation UI mariadb database. In order for a lab owner to update them, he/her must update the corresponding table entries. This inconvenience will be handled in the future.
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- The data of the lab silos (i.e. which silo is used by a lab in order to store results in Nexus) is stored in the mariadb database (look at the Database subsection). It is the blueprint owner's responsibility to publish it. Currently, this data is statically stored in the blueprint validation UI mariadb database. In order for a blueprint owner to update it, he/her must update the corresponding table entries. This inconvenience will be handled in the future.
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- The data of available blueprints (i.e. blueprint name) is stored in the mariadb database (look at the Database subsection). It is the blueprint owner's responsibility to publish it. Currently, this data is statically stored in the blueprint validation UI mariadb database. In order for a blueprint owner to update it, he/her must update the corresponding table entries. This inconvenience will be handled in the future.
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- The data of an available blueprint instance for validation (i.e. version, layer and description of the layer) is stored in the mariadb database (look at the Database subsection). It is the blueprint owner's responsibility to publish it. Currently, this data is statically stored in the blueprint validation UI mariadb database. In order for a blueprint owner to update it, he/her must update the corresponding table entries. This inconvenience will be handled in the future.
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- A Jenkins instance exists capable of executing blueprint validation tests on the specified lab and storing the results to Nexus server (look at the Jenkins configuration subsection).
  This prerequisite concerns only the full control loop mode.

- A Nexus server exists where all the blueprint validation results are stored (look at the Nexus subsection).
  This prerequisite concerns both of the UI modes.

- The whole installation and deployment of a blueprint and its corresponding blueprint family components (i.e. the appropriate edge cloud stack with its combination of infrastructure hardware components, OS, K8s, software, etc) are already performed in the appropriate lab.
  Recall that multiple labs can be used for a specific blueprint validation. Also, it is the responsibility of the blueprint submitter to ensure that the edge validation and community CI labs can support comprehensive validation of the blueprint and cover all use case characteristics.
  This prerequisite concerns both of the UI modes.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Database

A mariadb database instance is needed for both modes of the UI with the appropriate databases and tables in order for the back-end system to store and retrieve data.

The pom.xml file supports the creation of an appropriate docker image for development purposes. The initialization scripts reside under the db-scripts directory.

Also, a script has been developed, namely validation/docker/mariadb/deploy.sh which easily deploys the container. This script accepts the following as input parameters:

CONTAINER_NAME, name of the container, default value is akraino-validation-mariadb
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD, the desired mariadb root user password, this variable is required
UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD, the desired Blueprint Validation UI password for the admin user, this variable is required
UI_AKRAINO_PASSWORD, the desired Blueprint Validation UI password for the akraino user, this variable is required
REGISTRY, registry of the mariadb image, default value is akraino
NAME, name of the mariadb image, default value is validation
TAG_PRE, first part of the image version, default value is mariadb
TAG_VER, last part of the image version, default value is latest
MARIADB_HOST_PORT, port on which mariadb is exposed on host, default value is 3307

Currently, two users are supported for the UI, namely admin (full privileges) and akraino (limited privileges). Their passwords must be defined in the database.

Let's build and deploy the image using only the required parameters.

Configure the mariadb root user password (currently the UI connects to the database using root privileges), the UI admin password and the UI akraino password in the appropriate variables and execute the following commands in order to build and deploy this database container:

.. code-block:: console

    cd validation/ui
    mvn docker:build -Ddocker.filter=akraino/validation:dev-mariadb-latest
    cd ../docker/mariadb
    ./deploy.sh TAG_PRE=dev-mariadb MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root user password> UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<UI admin user password> UI_AKRAINO_PASSWORD=<UI akraino user password>
    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ../../ui/db-scripts/examples/initialize_db_example.sql

In order to retrieve the IP of the mariadb container, execute the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    docker inspect <name of the mariadb container>

Furthermore, the TAG_PRE variable should be defined because the default value is 'mariadb' (note that the 'dev-mariadb' is used for development purposes - look at pom.xml file).

If you want to re-deploy the database (it is assumed that the corresponding mariadb container has been stopped and deleted) and the persistent storage already exists (currently, the directory /var/lib/mariadb of the host is used), after the image build process, a different approach should be used.

To this end, another script has been developed, namely validation/docker/mariadb/deploy_with_existing_storage.sh which easily deploys the container. This script accepts the following as input parameters:

CONTAINER_NAME, name of the container, default value is akraino-validation-mariadb
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD, the desired mariadb root user password, this variable is required
REGISTRY, registry of the mariadb image, default value is akraino
NAME, name of the mariadb image, default value is validation
TAG_PRE, first part of the image version, default value is mariadb
TAG_VER, last part of the image version, default value is latest
MARIADB_HOST_PORT, port on which mariadb is exposed on host, default value is 3307

Let's deploy the image using only the required parameters and the existing persistent storage.

Configure the mariadb root user password (currently the UI connects to the database using root privileges) in the appropriate variable and execute the following commands in order to build and deploy this database container:

.. code-block:: console

    cd validation/docker/mariadb
    ./deploy_with_existing_persistent_storage.sh TAG_PRE=dev-mariadb MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root user password>

Finally, if you want to re-deploy the database (it is assumed that the corresponding mariadb container has been stopped and deleted) and delete the old persistent storage, you must first delete the directory on the host machine where data is stored (note that all database's data will be lost). To this end, after the image build process, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mariadb
    cd validation/docker/mariadb
    ./deploy.sh TAG_PRE=dev-mariadb MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<root user password> UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<UI admin user password> UI_AKRAINO_PASSWORD=<UI akraino user password>
    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ../../ui/db-scripts/examples/initialize_db_example.sql

In the context of the full control loop mode, the following tables must be initialized with appropriate data:

- lab (here every lab owner should store the name of the lab)
- timeslot (here every lab owner should register the available timeslots that can be used for blueprint validation test execution)
- silo (here every lab owner should register the silo which is used for storing results in Nexus, for example for AT&T lab the value is 'att-blu-val')
- blueprint (here every blueprint owner should register the name of the blueprint)
- blueprint_instance_for_validation (here every blueprint owner should register the blueprint instances for validation, i.e. version, layer and description of a layer)

The following file can be used for initializing the aforementioned data (as we did in the above example using the 'mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ../../ui/db-scripts/examples/initialize_db_example.sql' command):

    db-scripts/examples/initialize_db_example.sql

Some of this data is illustrated below (refer to 'org.akraino.validation.ui.data' package for more info regarding available values):

.. code-block:: console

    Lab
    id:1, lab:0 (0 stands for AT&T)

    Timeslots:
    id:1 , start date and time: 'now', duration: null, lab: 1

    Silo
    id:1, silo: 'att-blu-val', lab: 1

    Blueprints:
    id: 3 , name : 'REC'

    Blueprint Instances:
    id: 2, blueprint_id: 3 (i.e. REC), version: "latest", layer: 0 (i.e. Hardware), layer_description: "AT&T Hardware"

It should be noted that currently the start date and time and the duration of the timeslot are not taken into account by the UI (see limitation section). Therefore, a user should define 'now' and null respectively for their content.

Based on this data, the UI enables the user to select an appropriate blueprint instance for validation.

Currently, this data cannot be retrieved dynamically by the UI (see limitations subsection). For this reason, in cases of new data, a user should define new entries in this database.

For example, if a user wants to define a new lab with the following data:

    lab: Community

the following file should be created:

name: dbscript
content:
    SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
    use akraino;
    insert into lab values(2, 2);

2 stands for community lab. Refer to 'org.akraino.validation.ui.data' package for more info.

Then, the following command should be executed:

.. code-block:: console

    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ./dbscript.sql

For example, if a user wants to define a new timeslot with the following data:

    start date and time:'now', duration: 0, lab: AT&T

the following file should be created:

name: dbscript
content:
    SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
    use akraino;
    insert into timeslot values(2, 'now', null, 1);

1 is the id of the AT&T lab.

Then, the following command should be executed:

.. code-block:: console

    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ./dbscript.sql

For example, if a user wants to define a new silo with the following data:

    silo: 'community-blu-val', lab: AT&T

the following file should be created:

name: dbscript
content:
    SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
    use akraino;
    insert into silo values(2, 'community-blu-val', 2);

2 is the id of the community lab.

Then, the following command should be executed:

.. code-block:: console

    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ./dbscript.sql

Furthermore, if a user wants to define a new blueprint, namely "newBlueprint" and a new instance of this blueprint with the following data:

    version: "latest", layer: 2 (i.e. K8s), layer_description: "K8s with High Availability Ingress controller"

the following file should be created:

name: dbscript
content:
    SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;
    use akraino;
    insert into blueprint (blueprint_id, blueprint_name) values(4, 'newBlueprint');
    insert into blueprint_instance (blueprint_instance_id, blueprint_id, version, layer, layer_description) values(6, 4, 'latest', 2, 'K8s with High Availability Ingress controller');

Then, the following command should be executed:

.. code-block:: console

    mysql -p<MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD> -uroot -h <IP of the mariadb container> < ./dbscript.sql

The UI will automatically retrieve this new data and display it to the user.

- Jenkins Configuration

Recall that for full control loop, a Jenkins instance is needed capable of executing blueprint validation tests to the specified lab. The Blueprint validation UI will trigger job executions in that instance.

It should be noted that it is not the UI responsibility to deploy a Jenkins instance.

Furthermore, this instance must have the following option enabled: "Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security -> Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits".

Also, currently, the corresponding Jenkins job should accept the following as input parameters: "SUBMISSION_ID", "BLUEPRINT", "VERSION", "LAYER" and "UI_IP".
The "SUBMISSION_ID" and "UI_IP" parameters (i.e. IP address of the UI host machine-this is needed by the Jenkins instance in order to send back Job completion notification) are created and provided by the back-end part of the UI.
The "BLUEPRINT", "VERSION" and "LAYER" parameters are configured by the UI user.

Moreover, as the Jenkins notification plugin (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Notification+Plugin) seems to ignore proxy settings, the corresponding Jenkins job must be configured to execute the following commands at the end (Post-build Actions)

.. code-block:: console

    cookie=`curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X POST --insecure --silent http://$UI_IP:8080/AECBlueprintValidationUI/login_external -d "loginId=akraino&password=akraino" 2>&1 | grep "Set-Cookie: " | awk -F ':' '{print $2}'`
    curl -v --cookie $cookie -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --insecure --silent http://$UI_IP:8080/AECBlueprintValidationUI/api/jenkinsJobNotification/ --data '{"submissionId": "'"$SUBMISSION_ID"'" , "name":"'"$JOB_NAME"'", "buildNumber":"'"$BUILD_NUMBER"'"}'

It should be noted that the credentials user=akraino and password=akraino defined in the above commands should be replaced with the credentials of a real UI user. Recall that these credentials are defined in the database.

- Nexus server

All the blueprint validation results are stored in Nexus server for both modes of the UI.

It should be noted that it is not the UI responsibility to deploy a Nexus server.

In the context of the full control loop, these results must be available in the following url:

    https://nexus.akraino.org/content/sites/logs/<lab_silo>/job/<Jenkins Job name>/<Jenkins job number>/results/<layer>/<name_of_the_test_suite>.

where <lab_silo> is the silo used by a lab for storing results in Nexus (for example 'att-blu-val'), <Jenkins job name> is the Jenkins job name that is triggered by the UI, <Jenkins job number> is the number of the Jenkins job that produced this result, <layer> is the blueprint layer and <name_of_the_test_suite> is the name of the corresponding test suite.

If multiple test suites are available, multiple test suite names should be created.

Moreover, the results should be stored in the 'output.xml' file and placed in the aforementioned URL using the following format:

TBD

In the context of partial control, the results must be available in the following url:

TBD

Compiling
~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    cd validation/ui
    mvn clean package

Deploying
~~~~~~~~~

The pom.xml file supports the building of an appropriate container image using the produced war file. Also, a script has been developed, namely validation/docker/ui/deploy.sh which easily deploys the container.

This script accepts the following as input parameters:

CONTAINER_NAME, name of the contaner, default value is akraino-validation-ui
DB_CONNECTION_URL, the URL connection with the akraino database of the maridb instance, this variable is required
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD, mariadb root user password, this variable is required
REGISTRY, registry of the mariadb image, default value is akraino
NAME, name of the mariadb image, default value is validation
TAG_PRE, first part of the image version, default value is ui
TAG_VER, last part of the image version, default value is latest
JENKINS_URL, the URL of the Jenkins instance, this variable is required
JENKINS_USERNAME, the Jenkins user name, this variable is required
JENKINS_USER_PASSWORD, the Jenkins user password, this variable is required
JENKINS_JOB_NAME, the name of Jenkins job capable of executing the blueprint validation tests, this variable is required
NEXUS_PROXY, the proxy needed in order for the Nexus server to be reachable, default value is none
JENKINS_PROXY, the proxy needed in order for the Jenkins server to be reachable, default value is none

Let's build the image using only the required parameters. To this end, the following data is needed:

- The mariadb root user password (look at the Database subsection)
- The URL for connecting to the akraino database of the mariadb
- The Jenkins url
- The Jenkins username and password
- The name of Jenkins Job

Execute the following commands in order to build and deploy the UI container:

.. code-block:: console

    cd validation/ui
    mvn docker:build -Ddocker.filter=akraino/validation:dev-ui-latest
    cd ../docker/ui
    ./deploy.sh TAG_PRE=dev-ui DB_CONNECTION_URL=<Url in order to connect to akraino database of the mariadb> MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mariadb root password> JENKINS_URL=<http://jenkinsIP:port> JENKINS_USERNAME=<Jenkins user> JENKINS_USER_PASSWORD=<Jenkins password> JENKINS_JOB_NAME=<Jenkins job name>

The content of the DB_CONNECTION_URL can be for example 172.17.0.3:3306/akraino (i.e. IP and port of the database container plus '/akraino').

Furthermore, the TAG_PRE variable should be defined as the default value is 'ui' (note that the 'dev-ui' is used for development purposes - look at pom.xml file).

If no proxy exists, just do not define proxy ip and port variables.

The UI should be available in the following url:

    http://localhost:8080/AECBlueprintValidationUI

Note that the deployment uses the network host mode, so the 8080 must be available on the host.

User's guide
-----------------
TBD

Limitations
-----------
- The partial loop mode is not currently supported.
- The UI has been tested using Chrome and Firefox browsers.
- The back-end part of the UI does not take into account the start date and time and duration of the configured timeslot. It immediately triggers the corresponding Jenkins Job.
- Results data manipulation (filtering, graphical representation, indexing in time order, etc) is not supported.
- Only the following labs are supported: AT&T, Ericsson, Community and Arm.
- Only the following tabs are functional: 'Committed Submissions', 'Blueprint Validation Results -> Get by submission id'.
- The UI configures only the "BLUEPRINT", "VERSION", "LAYER", "SUBMISSION_ID" and "UI_IP" input parameters of the Jenkins job.
- The silos, labs, and the available blueprints and timeslots must be manually configured in the mariadb database.
- Logout action is not currently supported.
