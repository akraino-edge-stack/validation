The test can have the capability to customize the registry, and all you should need to change is prepend the registry name to the images in sonobuoy.yaml\n\nAlso, who sets this repository, where is it stored (master node, somewhere else), how is the login to it (for docker push) handled...? To me it seems a separate functionality altogether.",

      "message": "After yesterday\u0027s meeting and giving it some more thought, I think it makes sense to keep the functionality in the validation project, but it makes more sense to have it in the bluval logic. Blucon.py already starts the docker container + invokes the tests for each layer. I\u0027m thinking we can add a step before that to populate the private docker registry with the images needed by that layer. What do you think?",
