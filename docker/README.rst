Overview
========

The Makefile in this directory is used to build and push all
the validation containers. The default registry is **akraino** on
dockerhub, but only CI jenkins slaves are authorized to push
images to that registry. If you want to push to your own test registry, set
the REGISTRY variables as in the commands below.

To build and push the images:

.. code-block:: console
    make all [ REGISTRY=<dockerhub_registry> ]

To just build the containers, use the command:

.. code-block:: console
   make build-all [ REGISTRY=<dockerhub_registry> ]

The k8s container
=================

Building and pushing the container
----------------------------------

To build just the k8s container, use the command:

.. code-block:: console
   make k8s-build [ REGISTRY=<dockerhub_registry> ]

To both build and push the container, use the command:

.. code-block:: console
   make k8s [ REGISTRY=<dockerhub_registry> ]

Using the container
-------------------

The k8s image is meant to be ran from a server that has access to the
kubernetes cluster (jenkins slave, jumpserver, etc).

Before running the image, copy the folder ~/.kube from your kubernetes
master node to a local folder (e.g. /home/jenkins/k8s_access).

Container needs to be started with the kubernetes access folder mounted.
Optionally, the results folder can be mounted as well; this way the logs are
stored on the local server.

.. code-block:: console
   docker run -ti -v /home/jenkins/k8s_access:/root/.kube/ \
   -v /home/jenkins/k8s_results:/opt/akraino/validation/results/ \
   akraino/validation:k8s-latest

By default, the container will run the k8s conformance test. If you want to
enter the container, add */bin/sh* at the end of the command above
